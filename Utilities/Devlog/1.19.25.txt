Finished reaserch today, now on to developing the prototype

Didn't do much coding today but added world bariers and implemented a little face guy that follows the mouse

Tommorow I will work on intergrating fishing spots, if I have time randomly spawing them

The next step is learing how to make a basic gui, and making the fishing spots start the minigames
